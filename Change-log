added cool asf ascii art
make it so after the loaded time the text is white (huge update ik)
uhhhhh no fuckin' clue what to add next so dm me some ideas 
tried adding to v3rm but they strict asf about their policy 
added 2 extra line(s) to the "ad"
added a comma to work better (lol)
fixed serverhop
added a whitelist for certain Players\Friends
re-done the whole "ad" function 
Made "ad" also say random names in shit, example: randomPlayer.DisplayName.." / "randomplayer.Name.."Is cool ong"
removed the previous "ad" line because I cant fucking code
kthxbai

Under here is prolly where I will put the "Plans" for my shitz 
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Instead of using the gui, I might try to port it to an ACTUAL gui.
2. Find a chat-script that wasn't detected immediatly due to ROLVe (fuck you <3)
3. Make a development branch of the script so people can choose either "Main" or "Development" (Development will have more things in it, but more detectable (I think))
4. Attempt to spoof the "Announcement" Event to say shit
5.
